These are example settings for the user_setup.php file. Note: these are examples only.
For them to take effect you must put the appropriate line of code (under EXAMPLE CODE)
in user_setup.php.

PERMISSIONS | TYPE -> String | DEFAULT -> '0777'
	If you don't like that SlideShowPro Director creates everything with 777 privileges,
	add the following code to user_setup.php. (You can use any octal you want here,
	but it has to have a leading 0 (e.g '0644', '0755', etc))
	
	EXAMPLE CODE:
	$target_perms = '0755';
	
EXTERNALS | TYPE -> Boolean | DEFAULT -> true
	Director checks external sources for information on new version available, as well
	as the news panel of the dashboard. This can cause problems if the Director installation
	is not connected to the internet. If you want Director not to load this external data,
	add this to user_setup.php.
	
	EXAMPLE CODE:
	$externals = false;
	                       
MAKE INTERNAL THUMBNAILS | TYPE -> Boolean | DEFAULT -> true
	By default, Director creates a set of internal thumbnails to improve the responsiveness
	of the interface. However, if you are uploading large images on servers with memory
	limitations, this may cause Director to not complete the initial upload of images. Using
	the following code in user_setup.php will tell Director not to create these internal
	thumbnails.

	EXAMPLE CODE:
	$make_internals = false;
