The Court Jesters evolved when in the early 1990's Christchurch readily accepted and appreciated the humour, wit and risk in the improvised performance style of Theatresports.&nbsp;
<p>From there a professional troupe was developed offering the late night comedy show 'Scared Scriptless', now the longest running comedy show in New Zealand. The Jesters also perform a wide variety of other improvised and semi-scripted shows, appear regularly as corporate entertainers for businesses, societies, groups and festivals around Christchurch and New Zealand. The Jesters are constantly looking to usher in new talent by holding weekly community improv workshops and an annual Theatresports competition for high schools.<img width="277" height="260" align="right" alt="Ready to Serve" src="../../../../cmscontent/Image/RWaiters.jpg" /> <br /></p>
<p>Priding themselves on being adaptable and affordable, the Court Jesters try to ensure that every performance is unique and perfect for the event.</p>
