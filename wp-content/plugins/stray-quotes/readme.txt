Display random words everywhere on your blog. Easy to custom and manage. Ajax enabled. Compatible with WP 2.7.

== Description ==

Stray Random Quotes helps you collect and display random quotes everywhere on your blog. Actually, this plugin is so flexible that it can be used to display random words of all sorts: taglines, "leave a response" messages, footer or header sections etc.
The main features:

* As many **widgets** as you need, each with its individual set of options, to display one or more quotes from all or some categories, randomly or in sequence, with or without AJAX, etc.
* **AJAX** automation so a reader of the blog can get another quote without reloading the page.
* Optional **automatic rotation** of the quotes within a given interval of seconds.
* **Shortcodes** that can be used to add one quote or series of quotes to your posts and pages. The shortcodes come with a set of individual options as well and, if needed, they can be extended to apply everywhere on the blog, allowing random words for the tagline, the category names, the post titles etc.
* **Template tags** to add one or more quotes -- random words in general -- directly to the template pages. Template tags support many variables as well.
* A **Settings page** to customize the appearance of the quotes with little or no knowledge of HTML.
* A easy to use **management page** where even thousands of quotes can be handled easily, with bulk actions to change category, delete quotes and toggle visibility of many quotes at a time.
* A **bookmarklet** to create quotes on the fly as you browse the web and find text worth quoting.
* A **help page** where everything you need to know is explained.

_Note for translators: there is a lot to translate with this plugin, expecially on account of the help page. If you want to create a localized copy of Stray Random Quotes, consider skipping the help page and translate the rest. This will save you some time._
_The best way to submit new translations, or updates to old ones, is to include a direct link to the localization files in a comment to [this post](http://www.italyisfalling.com/stray-random-quotes#comments). This way the files are made available to the users sooner, and without waiting for a new release._

== Changelog ==

* 1.8.9 Fixed a few bugs to version 1.8.8 that included the following: Added: the quotes can now rotate automatically after a given interval of seconds. Added: widgets and template tags can load more than one quote a time; Added: the loading message can now be customized in the settings page; Added: Croatian translation thanks to [Rajic](http://stepinac.karmel.hr); Changed: the help page has been rewritten in large part. Changed: the widget options; Changed: removed the title options in the settings page, that were useless. Fixed: the loading message does not cause the collapsing of the quote area anymore. Fixed: many minor bugs. This version rewrites most of the code of the core functions, merging a great deal of lines and hopefully making the plugin more efficient.
* 1.8.6 Added: Chinese translation thanks to [WGMking](http://2say.hi.cn/); fixed: a rare bug caused by IIS-enabled servers (thanks to Tool).
* 1.8.5 Added: bulk editing ability to the management page; added: a dedicated Tools Page where fantastic things can be achieved (such as a bookmarklet and the ability to extend shortcodes to new areas of the blog, which in turn will allow you to have random quotes and words in unexpected locations); added: per-widget and per-tag ability to disable ajax; changed: the way the `[random-quote]` shortcode works (now accepts much more variables); fixed: pagination of the `[all-quotes]` shortcodes (thanks to frettsy). There are other enhancements and quite enough minor bugs fixed. So much of the innovation with this version is thanks to the suggestions and requests of the users, to them goes my most sincere gratitude.
* 1.8.3 This version comes with German translation, a million thanks to Markus Griesbach for providing it. Also fixed a MYSQL rare bug that caused the `random-quote` shortcode not to work: thanks to Zarban for the help catching it.
* 1.8.2 Added: the ability to entirely disable the ajax automation in the settings page. Added: the ability for those who add the quotes directly to the template, to also specify a "next quote" link phrase (see help page). Fixed: the loading of new quotes didn't work when no categories were selected. Fixed: Switching from "default" category wouldn't work with new quotes (thanks to AgentSmith for pointing this bug out.) Fixed: weird little things happening when the quotes were loaded not randomly and not from the widget with one category only. Changed: I removed from the set of files of the plugins the "lang" folder since it contained only a copy of the english version. It will be reinstated when someone will finally translate this plugin. 
* 1.8.1 This version fixes few bugs, mainly concerning the ajax automation where the quotes where loaded twice instead of just once. I also adjusted the transition between quotes, now it should feel a bit better.
* 1.8.0: Not only this version corrects the problems of the previous versions but for the first time it comes with ajax automation. For this achievement, many thanks go to the incredible contribution of [AgentSmith](http://www.matrixagents.org) who with generosity helped to develop this functionality and bypass many problems that it could have caused. In the settings page the user will be able to assign a link to dynamically fetch another quote and display it on the widget, _without reloading the page_. Missing that setting, the quote will be reloaded when the user click on it. Also, fixed in this version: the widget displaying only its title and not the quote. This was a problem that presented itself when only one group was selected in the widget options. Fixed: adding a link to the author or the source broke the ability of the "add new" page to present the same quote again. In general, one or two things could be different so always remember to check the help page before thinking that the plugin is malfunctioning. To do for the next versions: bulk editing and ajax for the manage page!
* 1.7.9_fix: Just a fix to the removal feature that did not work properly and did not remove the widget options. I didn't want to make this another version number since 1.8.0 will soon come with new features. Thanks to Robert Clay for enlightening me on this.
* 1.7.9 Following the crash of the previous version, I am forced to issue another fix. In case you were involved in the accident, here's what happened: wanting to change "groups" to "categories", I ventured in an SQL operation that in certain cases created a duplicated column... I don't know why, since for others worked without a problem. Doesn't matter. Furthermore, in version 1.7.8 I changed the names of certain options related to groups, but forgot to do so upon activation. This involved widgets as well. Because of all this, many users reported not being able to browse their quotes and even to display quotes on the blog using widgets. This version should fix all this and also remove the duplicate column in your database. Please deactivate before installing (if you don't upgrade automatically). To make a clean install, you might want consider removing the old options (using the plugin "remove" tool. I know it is annoying and you don't really have to do it) and backup the `wp_stray_quotes` table. It is not required but at this point, why not. I must thank for the precious help in (hopefully) understanding this matter: [xensen](http://www.follymuseum.com/) and [Andre Camara](http://www.lulalol.co.cc/). Thanks also to Rebecca, Robert Clay, Sab Guy, Bonnie and Jason for reporting the problem in a timely fashion.
* 1.7.8 Another hassle-fixing version while new functions are in the works. Fixed: the UTF8 support _again_, because the previous fix didn't work. Now it does work as far as I can tell! Fixed: the navigation within quotes in the `[all-quotes]` shortcode. Big thanks to Frettsy for pointing this bug out. Changed: "groups" are now called "categories". I think "groups" was a lame nomenclature to organize quotes with. "Categories" probably is even lamer. However, to have a column called "group" in a SQL table can create problems if for some reason backticks are forgotten. This change will affect only one thing for you, the use of the `[all-quotes]` shortcode with its options (more on the help page). Changed: the overview page is slightly more informative. Is all.
* 1.7.7 This version should fix the support for UTF8 characters as experienced in the settings page (thanks to Chrille for pointing the bug out). Please give me confirmation on this if you care. There is nothing else: although new things are hoepfully cooking for the next versions.
* 1.7.6 Added: ability to manually reset the index of the quotes if the numbers get too high (on the help page). Added: an overriding HTML element to put before the source when there is no author (on the settings page). Fixed: it is now impossible for category names to have spaces in them-- because it made things wacky (on the new and manage pages). If you do have spaces in the names of any of your categories, upon activation this version will replace them with dashes (don't worry about it, everything else will be untouched). Changed: when all the quotes are rendered on a post or a page, only the bottom navigation links will be present. I think the above ones were redundant. If you want them back, uncomment the line `304` in the file `stray_functions.php`. Changed: Now the user can choose whether after inserting a new quote the values should persist in the form or not (settings page)(thanks to AgentSmith for pointing this out). Fixed: titles of the pages are a little more explicative. Fixed: when switching how many quotes to show per page, the page number is reset to 1 to avoid false '"no quotes yet" messages (manage page). Fixed: few more little things.
* 1.7.5 I had to issue this other update right away for a much bigger bug that I just discovered at my own expenses (the loss of not one but two quotes). In short, whenever a quote was edited in the manage page and then the manage page was changed by sorting or picking a different category, the just edited quote would get emptied of all its content. Yep, you read it right. Hollowed out. I hope this hasn't happened to anyone else yet because there is no turning back unless you can enter the quote again. Anyway, this version solves the problem. I wish the bugs were discovered all together but this is not how it works.
* 1.7.4 OK, another version right away for a tiny bug that screwed up the creation of new categories for the new quotes: thanks to pupo, James and AgentSmith for catching the bug and saving the day. I also removed the quotes I had placed myself at the top of the pages: at first I thought they were fun, but they were also annoying. Man I hope this is the last update for a week at least.
* 1.7.3: This version has a new overview page (I don't know why); a dedicated help page; a more helpful "add new quote" page. It now handles links in author and source a little better, so that a specific link added to the author or source of a quote overrides the defaults indicated in the settings page. It also has a page for the removal of the plugin, quotes on every page, and it has been slightly redesigned here and there: more importantly it comes with many many fixes, some of which thanks to the help of the users, whom I thank profusely.
* 1.7.1: With this version the list of the quotes in a page or post can be paged (thanks to James and others who reminded me of this missing functionality). Also, the list of quotes can now be generated from one or some or all the categories. Refer to the overview page in the plugin menu for more details. On the fixing front, I solved a problem with shortcodes that were always displayed at the top of the post regardless their position in the post editor. I also might have found a temporary workaround for the "division by zero" problem someone encountered in the management page. I still have to figure that one out though since I can't reproduce the problem (I suspect it depends on the settings of each one's php server) so give me feedback on this if you have any. I also made minor corrections to some of the functions and a slight enhancement to the 'quotes' menu in the admin area. Some fixing and enhancement on the linking front is still to be made so be patient on that.
* 1.7 I think it is fair to say that this new version of Stray Random Quotes scores as a significative improvement. I could say 'dramatic'. It comes with new features, such as categories for quotes; a new management page; a new quote editor and much more. Most of the functions have been rewritten and all in all this version is definitively worth a try. After the update your widget might disappear. Just enable it again in the widget page. I temporarily removed the sketchy italian translation because there was still too much to translate. The plugin is localization-ready and eager for new translators though.
* 1.6.4 Wordpress 2.7 compatibility FIXED. Sorry, the last update was really pointless and not really compatible with anything. Also, I'm having a bunch of obtuse problems with connections and computers these days which should explain the delay with this fix. Sorry about it.
* 1.6.3 Wordpress 2.7 compatibility.
* 1.6.2 Fixed a compatibility issue with WP 2.6 which caused the available themes to not be displayed (thanks to all the users of Stray Random Quotes who pointed this bug out!). Also updated the layout of the option and manage pages to make them more consistent with the general design of WP.
* 1.6 This a major update (hence the slight jump forward in numbering): First of all, it takes advantage of the new Wordpress 2.5 [shortcuts_API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API "shortcuts API") by adding three different shortcuts to easily insert quotes inside your posts. In addition, it gives you the option to link author and source of your quotes to Wikipedia (not only to Google anymore) in all the major languages. Talking about language, this plugin is now ready for translations so come forward if you're willing to translate it in your own language. Only english and italian are available so far. This version contains a bunch of minor fixes and code rewriting, and also a few new names for its functions (you shouldn't notice any difference, but check out the installation instructions).
* 1.53 Hopefully fixed a little mishap with the code that caused the "updated table" message to persist. Also a link that didn't work should be fixed. Thanks to c for pointing these bugs out. Also I changed the name of the plugin to make it more to the point.
* 1.52 Finally managed to use "edit" and "delete" links instead of buttons in the list of quotes. Great personal achievement since I was never able to make this simple thing work. More minor fixes. 
* 1.51 Minor fixes.
* 1.50 Stray Quotes refurbished in order to work under Wordpress 2.5. Apparently it now does.
* 1.48 Corrected a typo that caused the plugin to throw a fatal error when activated. Usual messing up, no comment. While I was there I adjusted the way the plugin updates and creates the new table. It should work more cleverly now (nothing noticeable though).
* 1.47 This is a minor update to the general layout of the option and management pages. Hoping everything is more readable and usable now. Also I corrected the function where the "add new" form would display the content of the last inserted quote. Now the form does not display anything. Let me know if you don't think this way it is better. Few minor potential bugs hopefully corrected as well. Please be aware that the plugin now comes with five files (three .php, one .css and one .htm) instead than a single .php (which was getting too big and cumbersome to edit). So after you upload the folder with the new files, remember to delete the single file leftover by the old version.
* 1.46  I am really but once again I must update this plugin. Few slipping lines and a inattentive copy and paste caused an atrocious bug in the last version. Instead of editing old quotes it added them as new ones. Should be fixed now. It won't happen again for at least... a while now -- I promise.
* 1.45  Sorry for the many updates. It's because now I have the time. Anyway this version fixes the general functionality of the plugin where it would do certain crucial things (like updating the table to a new version) only if the management page was opened. Now it does what it has to do no matter what page is opened or not opened. I can't believe it I haven't solved this before, but this is how it goes.
* 1.44 As requested, a new field has been added to management page. It is now possible to specify the source of the quote and, in the option page, the relative optional formatting elements. Few potential bugs fixed.
* 1.43 Added a new option to set the default visibility for new quotes. In the options page.
* 1.42 with this update Stray Quotes should discriminate more intelligently the elements that can be added to both the sidebar and the quotes page, so that the page isn't filled with non pertinent formatting. More details on the options page itself.
* 1.41 corrected a general malfunction in the widget title, where it didn't handle unicode characters and disappeared from the sidebar or the options unexpectedly. Now everything should work. Thanks to tiosolid who addressed the bug. This is a fix version with no new features, but updating is strongly recommended.
* 1.4 first release. Numbering follows version number of the "Random Quotes" zombierobot.com/wp-quotes plugin from which my plugin takes its first steps.
